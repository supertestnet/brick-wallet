# Brick wallet
A web frontend for NWC wallets

# How to try it
Just click here: https://supertestnet.github.io/brick-wallet/

# What is this?
This is a basic web wallet with send, receive, and a history tab. If you try to use it, it will first ask you to connect it to a backend that supports NWC -- e.g. consider connecting it to [Bankify](https://supertestnet.github.io/bankify/). After that, you can send and receive money as well as view your transaction history.
